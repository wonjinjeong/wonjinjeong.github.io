There is a very simple way to have an impact on privacy and security by contributing to [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere).
It's a collaboration project between the [Tor project](https://www.torproject.org) and the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org) (EFF).

<small>Stripped from the project's webpage:</small>

> HTTPS Everywhere is a Firefox, Chrome, and Opera extension that encrypts your communications with many major websites, making your browsing more secure.

Note that *HTTPS Everywhere* comes pre-installed and pre-enabled with the
[Tor browser bundle](https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en) as well. The "*many major websites*" from the description, practically means that there are rules defined for the websites that support https.

How can you contribute?

While browsing with *HTTPS Everywhere* enabled, if you see a website that is not on https, try to access it with https. If the website is still functional, then you can very easily add a rule for it.
Fork the Github [repo](https://github.com/EFForg/https-everywhere) and

<pre><code data-trim class="bash">
cd src/chrome/content/rules
./make-trivial-rule &lt;the domain you want to add&gt;
</code></pre>

And the default rule set file will be created.
For example the trivial rule for di.uoa.gr can be generated by running:

<pre><code data-trim class="bash">
./make-trivial-rule di.uoa.gr
</code></pre>

and will look like this:

<pre><code data-trim class="xml">
&lt;ruleset name="National and Kapodistrian University of Athens - Department of Informatics and Telecommunications"&gt;
  &lt;target host="di.uoa.gr" /&gt;
  &lt;target host="www.di.uoa.gr" /&gt;
  &lt;rule from="^http:" to="https:" /&gt;
&lt;/ruleset&gt;
</code></pre>

Open a Pull Request on the [repo](https://github.com/EFForg/https-everywhere) and that's it!
A very quick way to have quite some impact on enhancing the privacy and security of the many :wink:
